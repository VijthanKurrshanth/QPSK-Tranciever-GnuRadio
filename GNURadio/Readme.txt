** The 'gnuradio_flowchart.grc' file is the complete GNURadio flowchart of the implemented qpsk transciver.
** Files and live voice can be transmitted by enabling/disabling appropriate blocks in the flow chart.
** Simulation of a transmission can be done by connecting a channel model between virtual sink and virtual source in the flow chart which consequently connects to rational resampler and baldeRF blocks (have to disable them).
** The same flow graph can be used in two computers as transmitter and reciever by disabling all the reciever blocks or transmitter blocks.
